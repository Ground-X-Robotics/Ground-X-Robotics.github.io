      We started the season in september 2019. It took a while to get the team going as we had to learn from scratch. 
      By November however we had a chasis which was built but wasn't moving
      In december however we had our first success with getting the robot moving and we went on a trip around our school.

      Next up we wanted to get the claw working. This was very tricky and we went through multiple different design iterations before settling on a final one.
      We managed to get this working well by mid january and also opted to add a secondary grabber at the back of the robot which helped us gain more points from moving the baseplate around
      The competition was the 11th of February and to be honest we didn't know what to expect.
