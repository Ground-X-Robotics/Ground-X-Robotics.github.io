        This is a test interaction, where clicking on the cubes sends an alert message to the browser, and a few messages to the console. A couple of the meessages sent are sent directly from Unity, however there is one that is called whenever a block is clicked that is called by Unity from JSLIB, simply stating the name of the object clicked. I'm going to keep randomly rambing on for more text so bla bla bla bla bla bla lorem ipsum sit dolor amet lorem ipsum sit dolor amet lorem ipsum sit dolor amet lorem ipsum sit dolor amet
